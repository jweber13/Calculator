# Calculator
A web-based calculator written in JavaScript, HTML &amp; CSS

This was the final project done for Odin's "Foundations" course. 

The calculator has functionality on all buttons. For now, only entering "=" or the "Enter" key will conclude the problem. 
'1' '+' '2' ('=' / 'Enter'): 3

Scripting was done with a "Calculator" class with built-in methods, accessed by event listeners on keys & buttons. 
HTML imports fonts from Google fonts.
